## Working in a local database

Remember DO NOT run any scripts that you are unfamiliar with. 

ALWAYS talk to a technical lead first before running any scripts, unless you are 100% familiar with them.

When working on PeerPresents always make sure you are working with a local version of the database so that you do not accidently modify, break, or delete the existing database that the live version of the PeerPresents website uses.

In order to do this you will need to create a local instance of the database on your local machine. 

Instructions for this can be found here: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/connect/#local-mongodb-instance-on-a-non-default-port

You will want to connect to the local port 19006 which PeerPresents runs on.
