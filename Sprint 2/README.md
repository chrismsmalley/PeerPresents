The project repo we will be updating can be found at: https://github.com/Ludolab/PeerPresents

Our clients instructed to specifically focus on development environment setup during this sprint as there were [unknown] difficulties for previous developers. They further requested that we maintain documentation about changes or deviations to the guides included in the repo's existing documentation. Each member of TEAM___? had access to a different combination of hardware and operating system, and by the end of this sprint we were successful with an x86_64/Linux installation and setup which was demonstrated in class; over spring break, the other two members will explore this option in order to facilitate progress on testing and development in sprint 3.

Included in the Sprint 2 directory are the following files:

Updated Team Contract to reflect pronounciation of TEAM___? name (Team Fill-in-the-Blank)
- Team Contract (Updated).docx

Daily check-ins primarily occurred in Discord - please refer to Timesheet.xlsx for details

In-person meetings were held on Tuesdays and Thursdays; notes from each meeting follow the format:
- Month_Day_Year Team Meeting Notes.docx

Client meetings were held over Discord, and notes are named following the format:

A draft of documentation for changes with respect to the repo's existing setup guides for successful development environment setup is included. The client has not yet requested this document, and as such it is a work in progress. We will improve readability in upcoming sprints as other members of the team are able to provide feedback based on their own experience.
