Hi! We're **TEAM___?**, and we're developing data analytics features for [PeerPresents](https://github.com/Ludolab/PeerPresents
),
> "a web-based system for in-class peer feedback during student presentations"

 for our Spring 2023 Capstone project at the University of Memphis.

Presently, our third sprint is drawing to a close and during which we've made some tangible development progress after resolving development environment setup issues. This project has been developed by many teams over a number of years. As the packages and modules used to build this app have matured, the various updates, deprecations, and abandonments of these tools has lead to difficulties in functionality while preserving or meeting dependency requirements. At the beginning of this sprint, our team completed the development environment setup, but encountered issues slowing our development progress once we began working with the existing code related to data sets. These new obstacle have diverted our attention, but we're pleased to report that the majority of the team has resolved these problems and is able to code and test freely moving forward. We also have a fallback plan in case any issues persist to work collaboratively on the development tasks to ensure we meet our goals.
