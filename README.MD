Hi! We're **TEAM___?**, and we're developing data analytics features for [PeerPresents](https://github.com/Ludolab/PeerPresents
),
> "a web-based system for in-class peer feedback during student presentations"

 for our Spring 2023 Capstone project at the University of Memphis.

Presently, our fourth and sprint is drawing to a close and during which we've made some tangible development progress. This project has been developed by many teams over a number of years. As the packages and modules used to build this app have matured, the various updates, deprecations, and abandonments of these tools has lead to difficulties in functionality while preserving or meeting dependency requirements. Our code implementation was focused in two sections /frontend/src/components/GraphsContainer.js & Graph.js. At the beginning of this sprint, our team divided up individual components of the graph functionality. The three components were to implement select data type drop down functionality, Y Axis and X Axis functionality. We are pleased to report that we have made positive progress towards implementing all those features. With this being our final working sprint we have are able to display some of the functionality for the final demo.
